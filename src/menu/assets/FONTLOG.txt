Basic Font Information
----------------------

Triod Postnaja attempts to mimic the typefaces used to publish Old Church
Slavonic service books prior to the 20th century. It also provides a range of
Latin letters in the same style, sufficient for the needs of central, northern
and western European languages.

Most Old Church Slavonic fonts that provide Latin ranges are problematic in the
Latin lowercase, because they are not imitating the uncial style; I have
attempted to avoid this problem, especially in lowercase letters with ascenders
or descenders.

I created many of the basic Cyrillic letterforms after eyeballing a very
low-resolution image of the repertoire of Monotype Old Bulgarian.
