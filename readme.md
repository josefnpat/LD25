Ludum Dare 25

You Are the Villain
===============

You're not a good guy. You've never been a good guy. Some would even call you a villain. But being a villain is pretty damn lonely and no one deserves to be alone right? Of course you can't just take any companion. She has to be of a bloodline to give status to your evil lineage. So, you decided that the local princess would make the best consort for you.

Unfortunately, the King doesn't really like the idea of you as a son-in-law. So, he has sent an army of Knights and Wizards to break into your dungeons and take the Princess back!

Use your magical fireball and array of evil traps to keep the enemies at bay until you can open a magical portal and escape the heroes clutches!

Hints:
======

* Use WASD or Arrow keys to move around the map
* 1 to lay a trap to slow heroes
* 2 to lay a spike trap to harm heroes
* 3 or Left Shift to shoot fireballs
* Space to pick up the princess 

Featuring:
